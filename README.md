# Hotel-Booking-Analysis

**Project Summary:-

This EDA project on Hotel Booking Analysis investigates cancellations, and their underlying patterns; 
and suggests measures that can be implemented to reduce cancellations and secure revenue

The project covers booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel including information such 
as when the booking was made, length of stay, and the number of adults, and children. The project went 
through the basic idea of the EDA and visualization process.

In this project, I will do Exploratory Data Analysis on the given dataset. The project suggests 
measures that can be implemented to reduce cancellations and secure revenue. For example, hotels 
can offer discounts or promotions to customers who book early or who book for longer stays. Hotels 
can also offer incentives such as free parking or free breakfast to customers who book directly with 
them instead of through third-party websites.

This EDA involves following steps where in first step involves exploration and inspection of raw 
data, and in the second step I dealt with data impurities and cleaned the data by handling 
null values and dropping irrelevant data from the dataset.

This EDA is divided into the following 3 analyses: 

Univariate analysis: Univariate analysis is the simplest of the three analyses where the data, you are 
analyzing is only one variable.

Bivariate analysis: Bivariate analysis is where you are comparing two variables to study their 
relationships. 

Multivariate analysis: Multivariate analysis is similar to Bivariate analysis but you are comparing 
more than two variables.

The project concludes that by analyzing hotel booking data and understanding cancellations 
patterns, hotels can take steps to reduce cancellations and increase revenue.

Problem Statement:-

Have you ever wondered when the best time of year to book a hotel room is? Or the optimal length 
of stay in order to get the best daily rate? What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was 
likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests? This hotel booking dataset 
can help you explore those questions! This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and 
a resort hotel and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the 
number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other 
things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data.

Business Objective?

The project aims to gain an interesting insight into customersâ€™ behavior when booking a hotel. The 
demand for different segment of a customer may differ and forecasting become harder as it may 
require different model for different segment. These insights can guide hotels to adjust their 
customer strategies and make preparations for unknown
